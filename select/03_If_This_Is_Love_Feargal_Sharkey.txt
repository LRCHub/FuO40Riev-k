When I was a young man I guess you could say
I would hopefully smile at the start of each day
No girl was a stranger who'd sit by my side
But then I found the secret that you cannot hide
For love is a gamble but this is no bet
The more you give the less you get

This is love
This is love
This is love
I don't want no part of it
Get to the heart of it

The more I tried to find you the more you got lost
I knew that I must have you no matter the cost
But all this is over I've thrown off those chains
You're looking at a man who's pulled in those reins
Over and over
I tried not to ring
But each time I called
I heard just one thing
Love is a gamble but this is no bet
The more you give the less you get

This is love
This is love
This is love
I don't want no part of it
Get to the heart of it

This is love
This is love

For love is a gamble but this is no bet
The more you give the less you get

This is love
This is love
This is love
I don't want no part of it
Get to the heart of it

This is love
This is love
This is love
I don't want no part of it
Get to the heart of it

This is love
This is love
This is love
I don't want no part of it
Get to the heart of it

This is love
This is love
This is love
