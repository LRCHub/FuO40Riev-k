Never had a feelin', never felt what I'm needin', 'til tonight
Never had a reason, ohh. to believe it
But I couldn't see, with my eyes..., this is the first time
Losin' all my senses, I keep forgettin', I don't have to dream...
Nobody ever mentioned how close I'd be gettin'
Ta you, and you ta me...
It comes over me, when our bodies touch
Lookin' in your eyes they tell me so much
If this is love that we feel inside.
If this is love let's hold on to this night
If this is love
I feel like I've taken, a drug that was made in, the sweetest fantasy...
My heart's overtaken but it can't be mistaken
This was planned for you an' me...
When I look in your eyes they tell me so much...
If this is love that we feel inside.
If this is love let's hold on to this night
If this is love
If this is love that survives the storm.
If this is love that is keeping us warm
- Hold on to the night...
- If this is, if this is love
If this is, if this is love
If this is, if this is love
If this is love that we feel inside.
If this is love let's hold on to this night
If this is, if this is love
If this is love that survives the storm.
If this is love that is keeping us warm.
If this is, if this is love...
- If this is love...
- If this is, if this is love
If this is, if this is love...
If this is love that we feel inside.
If this is love, hold on to this night.
- If this is, if this is love...
- If this is, if this is love...
