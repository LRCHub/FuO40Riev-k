You came to me, baby
And I though that I saw love in your eyes
(Love in your eyes)
But all the promises you made were not to be
I should have seen through your disguise

Ohh, no baby
You know you always tried to make me look the fool
(Make me look the fool)
What's goin' on
You used to be so good to me, now what is wrong

Won't tell me why you wanna hurt me
Is this the way that love has got to be?
Now baby, I, I can't take it
If this is love then love's not meant for me
Not meant for me

If this is love
If this is love

What has happened to you lately
I don't sense that lovin', feelin' anymore
(Sense that lovin', feelin' anymore)
Every time you bring me down, I wanna cry
Do you wanna see me walkin' out that door?
(Out that door)

Won't tell me why you wanna hurt me
Is this the way that love has got to be?
Now baby, I, I can't take it
If this is love then love's not meant for me

Won't tell me why you wanna hurt me
Is this the way that love has got to be?
Now baby, I, I can't take it
If this is love then love's not meant for me
Not meant for me

If this is love
If this is love
If this is love

Ohh, no baby
You know you're always trying to make me look the fool

(Won't you tell me)
Tell me why you wanna hurt me
Is this the way that love has got to be?
No baby, I, I can't take it
If this is love then love's not meant for me
(No, no it's not meant for me)

(Won't tell me why)
Won't tell me why
Is this the way that love has got to be?
(Love has got to be)
Now baby, I, I can't take it
If this is love then love's not meant for me
(If this is love then love's not meant for me)

Won't tell me why
(Oh baby, I)
Is this the way that love has got to be?
(Is this the way that love)
Now baby, I
